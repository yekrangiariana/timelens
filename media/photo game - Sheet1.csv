Starving Child And Vulture,1993,media/photo1.jpg,"Taken during a famine in Sudan caused by drought, war, and government policies, the photo ""Starving Child and Vulture"" led to the photographer Kevin Carter's suicide in the mid-90s.","Kevin Carter knew death all too well. As a member of the Bang-Bang Club, a fearless group of photographers documenting apartheid-era South Africa, he had seen more than his fair share of tragedy. But in 1993, he traveled to Sudan to capture the horrors of the famine ravaging the land.

After a grueling day of taking pictures in the village of Ayod, Carter ventured into the bush and stumbled upon a heartbreaking scene. A frail and starving toddler had collapsed on the way to a feeding center, and as he took the child's photo, a vulture landed nearby.

Carter was warned not to touch the victims due to the risk of disease, so instead, he waited for 20 minutes in the hopes that the bird would spread its wings. When it didn't, he scared it off and watched as the child made their way to the center. He then lit a cigarette, prayed, and wept.

The New York Times published the photo, sparking a heated debate over whether photographers should intervene in such situations. Readers were desperate to know the fate of the child, and many criticized Carter for not doing more to help. Later research suggested that the child survived but died 14 years later from malaria.

Carter won a Pulitzer Prize for his photo, but the darkness of that fateful day never left him. In July 1994, he tragically took his own life, haunted by the memories of the pain, anger, and death that he had witnessed throughout his career.",Kevin Carter,
Lunch Atop A Skyscraper,1932,media/photo2.jpg,"Taken during the Great Depression, ""Lunch Atop a Skyscraper"" shows construction workers having lunch on a steel beam high above New York City streets during the building of Rockefeller Center.","The scene is both carefree and treacherous: 11 men, enjoying lunch, smoking, and chatting as if they weren't hovering 840 feet above Manhattan on a narrow beam. But make no mistake, these men are the ironworkers who helped construct the mighty Rockefeller Center.

The iconic photo, taken on the 69th floor of what is now the GE Building, was staged as part of a promotional campaign for the colossal skyscraper complex. The photographer's identity remains a mystery to this day, with Charles C. Ebbets, Thomas Kelley, and William Leftwich all present on the day of the shoot.

For New York's ironworkers, the photo is a badge of honor, a symbol of their intrepid tribe. But Lunch Atop a Skyscraper means so much more than that. It embodies American resilience and ambition, a fearless spirit that was desperately needed during the Great Depression.

For New Yorkers, the photo is a powerful reminder that their city is a place that tackles monumental projects without hesitation. And like all great symbols, Lunch Atop a Skyscraper has spawned its own economy. It is the most reproduced image of the Corbis photo agency, and it's impossible to walk through Times Square without seeing it plastered on a mug, magnet, or T-shirt.

In a city built on hustle and grit, Lunch Atop a Skyscraper remains a timeless tribute to the brave souls who built New York from the ground up.",Unknown,
The Terror Of War,1972,media/photo3.jpg,"The photo ""The Terror of War"" was taken during a conflict in Southeast Asia, in which the United States played a major role. This conflict lasted for over a decade, with some of the most intense fighting taking place after the second half of the 20st century.","In June 1972, Nick Ut, an Associated Press photographer, found himself outside the village of Trang Bang, just northwest of Saigon. It was there that he witnessed the devastating impact of collateral damage and friendly fire firsthand. But this was no ordinary incident - it was captured by Ut's lens, and the image he captured would go on to become one of the defining symbols of the Vietnam War.

As Ut snapped photos of the destruction, he saw something that he would never forget - a group of children and soldiers, along with a screaming, naked girl running towards him. In that moment, Ut knew he had to act fast. He poured water on the girl's body to soothe her burns, and then took her to a hospital. There, he learned that the girl, Phan Thi Kim Phuc, might not survive. With the help of his colleagues, Ut got Kim Phuc transferred to an American facility for treatment that ultimately saved her life.

Ut's photo of Kim Phuc's raw pain and suffering became an unforgettable reminder of the horrors of war. It highlighted the fact that the conflict was causing more harm than good, and it sparked a fierce debate in newsrooms around the world about whether or not to publish a photo that showed nudity. But despite the controversy, the image quickly became a cultural touchstone, standing alongside other iconic photographs like Malcolm Browne's Burning Monk and Eddie Adams' Saigon Execution.

When President Richard Nixon questioned the authenticity of the photo, Ut was quick to set the record straight, saying, ""The horror of the Vietnam War recorded by me did not have to be fixed."" And in 1973, the Pulitzer committee agreed, awarding Ut its prize. That same year, America's involvement in the war ended, but Ut's photo continues to serve as a powerful reminder of the devastating human cost of conflict.",Nick Ut,Public domain 
The Burning Monk,1963,media/photo4.jpg,"The Burning Monk"" was photographed during a turbulent time in the history of Vietnam, when political and religious tensions were high. This decade saw the rise of the Buddhist Crisis, which culminated in a series of protests against the South Vietnamese government and its discriminatory policies towards Buddhists.","Vietnam - a far-off land that most Americans had never heard of. But that all changed when Malcolm Browne, an Associated Press photographer, captured a searing image that would burn itself into the world's memory. The image was of Thich Quang Duc, a Buddhist monk who set himself alight on a bustling Saigon street, in protest against the oppressive regime of President Ngo Dinh Diem.

Browne had received advance warning of the impending act of self-immolation, and he was there to witness it all. He watched as two monks poured gasoline over the elderly man, and then, with a sense of horror and urgency, he began snapping photos, one after another.

The resulting image of the monk, seated calmly in a lotus position, as he burned alive, became the first iconic image of a conflict that would soon draw America in. Quang Duc's martyrdom became a symbol of the instability and unrest that plagued his nation, and it forced people to question America's support of Diem's regime.

As President Kennedy later remarked, ""No news picture in history has generated so much emotion around the world as that one."" Browne's photo was a game-changer, leading to the Administration's decision not to interfere with a coup that November. Its raw power moved people to action, and in doing so, it helped to shape the course of history.",Malcolm Browne,
Tank Man,1989,media/photo5.jpg,"During political unrest in China, ""Tank Man"" captured a historic protest in Beijing's Tiananmen Square for political freedoms and democratic reforms, met with violent government crackdowns causing tragic loss of life and international condemnation.","On the morning of June 5, 1989, photographer Jeff Widener found himself on a sixth-floor balcony of the Beijing Hotel, overlooking Tiananmen Square. The day before, Chinese troops had launched a brutal crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators, and Widener was there to capture the aftermath.

As he took pictures of the carnage below, a column of tanks rumbled out of the square. Then, a remarkable thing happened. A man with shopping bags in hand stepped in front of the massive machines, waving his arms and refusing to move. The tanks tried to go around him, but he stepped back into their path, even climbing atop one briefly. Widener thought the man would be killed, but the tanks held their fire. The man was eventually whisked away, but not before Widener immortalized his defiant act.

Others also captured the scene, but it was Widener's image that would become iconic. His photo was transmitted over the AP wire and appeared on front pages around the world. Decades later, the identity of the man in the photo remains a mystery, adding to its power as a symbol of resistance against unjust regimes everywhere. Tank Man has become a global hero, his brave stand a reminder that even in the face of overwhelming force, the human spirit cannot be defeated.",Jeff Widener,
Falling Man,2001,media/photo6.jpg,"Falling Man"" was taken after the 9/11 attacks in New York City, which caused almost 3,000 deaths and had significant global impact, leading to increased security measures and changes in air travel regulations to combat terrorism.","When we think of 9/11, we think of planes and towers, but there's one image that stands apart: Falling Man. Richard Drew's photograph captures one man's escape from the collapsing buildings, a solitary figure against the backdrop of impersonal skyscrapers.

In a day of mass tragedy, Falling Man is one of the few widely seen photos that shows someone dying. The picture appeared in newspapers across America in the days after the attacks, but the reaction from readers was swift and harsh, forcing it into temporary obscurity. It's a challenging image to process, with the man dividing the iconic towers as he plummets earthward like an arrow.

The identity of the Falling Man remains a mystery, but he is thought to have worked at the Windows on the World restaurant, which was situated atop the north tower. Yet, it's not who the subject was that gives Falling Man its power, but rather what he represents: an anonymous soldier in an often-hidden and uncertain war, suspended in time for all eternity. Falling Man reminds us that in the midst of chaos and tragedy, individuals continue to stand out, even as they fall.",Richard Drew,
Alan Kurdi,2015,media/photo7.jpg,"The photo of Alan Kurdi drew international attention to the European migrant crisis, caused by the conflict in Syria that displaced millions of people, leading to many risking their lives on the dangerous journey across the Mediterranean Sea in search of safety and a better life, and sparked a debate for greater support and protection for refugees.","After four years of brutal conflict in Syria, Alan Kurdi’s parents made the fateful decision to escape with their two young sons, setting off from the Turkish coast in an inflatable boat headed for the Greek island of Kos, just a few miles away. But within minutes of launching, a wave overturned the vessel, and Alan, his brother, and their mother drowned.

Hours later, Nilufer Demir of the Dogan News Agency found Alan’s lifeless body washed up on the shore near Bodrum. His face was turned to one side, his bottom elevated as if he were asleep. “There was nothing left to do for him. There was nothing left to bring him back to life,” Demir said. So she raised her camera.

“I thought, This is the only way I can express the scream of his silent body,” Demir recalled. The resulting image would become the defining photograph of an ongoing war that had claimed over 220,000 lives by the time she pressed the shutter. The picture was not taken in Syria, a country that the world had largely ignored, but on the doorstep of Europe, where refugees were arriving in droves.

The child lay dressed for travel, suspended between two worlds: the waves had washed away any traces of the dusty, brown landscape that might have located him in a foreign place. It was an experience that the Kurdi family had sought for themselves, joining a migration fueled by both desperation and aspiration.

Already having escaped bloodshed by crossing the border to Turkey, the family had embarked on a perilous sea journey in search of a better life. And although their journey had ended in tragedy, their story would resonate with people around the world.

Demir’s image quickly spread across social media, accumulating power with each share. News organizations were compelled to publish it – or to publicly defend their decision not to. And European governments were suddenly forced to open their borders, with trainloads of Syrians arriving in Germany to cheers within a week of the photo's release.

In an instant, the picture of one small, still form unlocked emotions that had lain dormant throughout the war, prompting a global outpouring of grief and forcing people to confront the human cost of the conflict.",Nilüfer Demir,
Earthrise,1968,media/photo8.jpg,"The photo ""Earthrise"" was taken during the Apollo 8 mission, which was the first crewed spacecraft to orbit the Moon. The mission was launched during a turbulent time in American history marked by social and political upheaval, including the Vietnam War and the Civil Rights Movement.","Pinpointing the exact moment that history takes a turn is no easy feat. But when it comes to humanity's realization of the fragility, beauty, and loneliness of our world, we know the exact instant. It was December 24, 1968, precisely 75 hours, 48 minutes, and 41 seconds after the Apollo 8 spacecraft took off from Cape Canaveral on its way to becoming the first manned mission to orbit the moon.

On that Christmas Eve, astronauts Frank Borman, Jim Lovell, and Bill Anders had entered lunar orbit after a year of war and violence in America. During the fourth orbit, as their spacecraft emerged from the far side of the moon, a breathtaking view of the blue-white planet filled one of the hatch windows.

""Wow, is that pretty!"" Anders exclaimed, snapping a black-and-white photo. Lovell searched for a color canister. ""Well, I think we missed it,"" Anders said. But Lovell persisted and found the color canister. ""Hey, I got it right here!"" he exclaimed.

Weightless Anders rushed over to where Lovell was floating and snapped his Hasselblad camera. ""You got it?"" Lovell asked. ""Yep,"" Anders answered. That image, our first full-color view of our planet from outside it, helped ignite the environmental movement. And, equally important, it helped humans recognize that despite the cold and punishing cosmos, we have it pretty good.",William Anders,
Mushroom Cloud Over Nagasaki,1945,media/photo9.jpg,"""Mushroom Cloud Over Nagasaki"" was taken in Japan during World War II, after the US dropped an atomic bomb on the city. The bombing occurred on the final months of the war, and was a major turning point in world history, leading to the end of the war and the beginning of the nuclear age.","In August 1945, the United States dropped an atomic bomb, Fat Man, on Nagasaki, Japan, just three days after a similar bomb, Little Boy, was detonated in Hiroshima. Lieutenant Charles Levy, the bombardier, witnessed the catastrophic event and captured its magnitude in a series of 16 photographs. One of those photographs, showing the mushroom cloud rising up to 45,000 feet, became a symbol of the bomb's destructive power and was widely circulated.

Despite censorship of the bomb's devastation, Levy's image, the only one to fully capture the mushroom cloud from the air, shaped American opinion in favor of the nuclear bomb. The bombings ultimately forced Japan's unconditional surrender in World War II and ushered in the atomic age. The photograph's impact proved, once again, that history is written by the victors.",Lieutenant Charles Levy,
V-J Day In Times Square,1945,media/photo10.jpg,"V-J Day in Times Square"" was taken in New York City at the end of war when Japan announced its surrender to the Allied Powers, bringing a sense of joy and relief to a nation that had been at war for several years.","Photography captures life’s fleeting moments, and for Alfred Eisenstaedt, one of LIFE magazine’s first photographers, his mission was to seize the storytelling moment. He didn’t have to look far for it when World War II came to an end on August 14, 1945. Taking in the jubilant atmosphere of New York City’s streets, Eisenstaedt found himself in the midst of the joyous commotion at Times Square.

As he searched for subjects, a sailor in front of him grabbed hold of a nurse, tilted her back, and kissed her. Eisenstaedt’s photograph of that passionate embrace distilled the relief and promise of that momentous day in a single frame of pure, unbridled joy (though some argue it should be viewed as sexual assault).

His exquisite image has become the most famous and reproduced photograph of the 20th century, embodying our collective memory of that transformative moment in world history. As Eisenstaedt once said, “People tell me that when I’m in heaven, they will remember this picture.”",Alfred Eisenstaedt,
Pillars Of Creation,1995,media/photo11.jpg,"""Pillars Of Creation"" was taken during a time when the Hubble Telescope was making groundbreaking observations and discoveries about our universe. ","The universe is a marvel to behold, but for most of us, it remains a distant abstraction. That is until the Hubble Space Telescope arrived in orbit. The story of Hubble is one of overruns, delays and failures, but its first breathtaking image in 1995, nicknamed the Pillars of Creation, made it all worth it.

The Pillars of Creation is a stunning portrait of the Eagle Nebula, a celestial region 6,500 light-years away, where stars are born. The image reveals colossal columns of interstellar gas and dust, sculpted by the winds of massive stars. These pillars of cosmic architecture are a true marvel of the universe, stretching 5 light-years long, equivalent to 30 trillion miles.

But the Pillars of Creation is not just a scientific discovery; it's also an emotional one. The image has a profound effect on our sense of wonder and awe, revealing the beauty and vastness of the cosmos. It reminds us that we are but a small part of a vast and mysterious universe, and in that realization, there is both humility and wonder.",NASA,
Fire Escape Collapse,1975,media/photo12.jpg,"""Fire Escape Collapse"" was taken during a period of significant urban decay and neglect in the  Boston, Massachusetts, United States. The photo brought attention to the need for better building codes and safety regulations to protect residents of urban areas.","On July 22, 1975, Stanley Forman was on the scene of a fire at Marlborough Street, working as a photographer for the Boston Herald American. Upon arriving, Forman saw a woman and a child on a fifth-floor fire escape, and he thought he was photographing another routine rescue. Suddenly, the fire escape collapsed, and Diana Bryant, 19, and her goddaughter Tiare Jones, 2, fell through the air. Forman photographed the tragic event as it unfolded, capturing the exact moment the pair were falling.

“I was shooting pictures as they were falling—then I turned away. It dawned on me what was happening, and I didn’t want to see them hit the ground. I can still remember turning around and shaking,” Forman later recalled. Bryant died from the fall, but her body cushioned the blow for her goddaughter, who survived.

Forman's photograph, taken with a motor-drive camera, shows the despairing expression on young Tiare's face during the dreadful moment. The photograph went on to earn Forman the Pulitzer Prize and brought about tougher fire-escape-safety codes around the country. However, the photograph's lasting impact was not just temporal but ethical as well. Many readers criticized the publication of Forman's image, and it remains a case study in the debate over when disturbing images are worth sharing.",Stanley Forman,
A Man On The Moon,1969,media/photo13.jpg,"""A Man on the Moon"" was taken during the Apollo 11 mission to the moon. ","The Sea of Tranquility, on the moon's ancient surface, is home to a small depression where Buzz Aldrin stood on July 20, 1969, in the evening. Although billions of pits and craters can be found on the lunar surface, it may not be Aldrin's most memorable moment.

Aldrin was disappointed in being the second man to step on the moon, missing out on the historic ""first-man"" designation earned by Neil Armstrong by a matter of inches and minutes. However, Aldrin achieved a different type of immortality.

Since Armstrong carried the crew's 70-millimeter Hasselblad, he took all of the pictures, which meant that the only moon man people on Earth would see clearly was the one who took the second steps.

It was unlikely that this image would endure the way it has. It lacks the action of the shots of Aldrin descending the ladder of the lunar module, and it has none of the patriotic significance of his saluting the American flag.

Aldrin stands still, a small, vulnerable man on a distant world where removing even a single article of clothing would result in death. His arm is awkwardly bent, possibly because he was checking the checklist on his wrist.

Armstrong, appearing even smaller and more spectral, is reflected in Aldrin's visor. This picture, in some ways, did everything wrong if it aimed to be heroic. However, as a result, it did everything right.",Neil Armstrong,
"Albino Boy, Biafra",1969,media/photo14.jpg,"""Albino Boy, Biafra"" was taken during the Nigerian Civil War, in which The Nigerian government imposed a blockade on Biafra, which led to severe food shortages and malnutrition, particularly among children.","Biafra, the short-lived breakaway state in West Africa that seceded from southern Nigeria in 1967, may have been forgotten by many, but the images of the mass starvation and disease that followed remain seared in our collective memory. No photo, however, captured the human tragedy of that brief war as powerfully as British war photographer Don McCullin’s image of a 9-year-old albino child.

“To be a starving Biafran orphan was to be in a most pitiable situation, but to be a starving albino Biafran was to be in a position beyond description,” McCullin wrote. “Dying of starvation, he was still among his peers an object of ostracism, ridicule and insult.”

The photograph was a turning point in the conflict, galvanizing public opinion and leading to massive airlifts of food, medicine and weapons. McCullin’s hope was that such stark images would be able to “break the hearts and spirits of secure people,” and they did.

Although the world’s attention eventually shifted, McCullin’s work left a lasting impact. His photographs, along with those of other witnesses of the conflict, inspired the launch of Doctors Without Borders, the humanitarian organization that delivers emergency medical support to those suffering from war, epidemics and disasters.",Don Mccullin,
Jewish Boy Surrenders In Warsaw,1943,media/photo15.jpg,"The photo ""Jewish Boy Surrenders in Warsaw"" was taken during the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising a significant act of Jewish resistance.","The haunting image at the heart of this photograph shows a frightened young boy with his arms raised, standing at the center of the Warsaw ghetto - a brutal corner of the city where nearly half a million Jews were confined, left to suffer and die at the hands of their Nazi oppressors. In July 1942, the Germans began shipping off Warsaw's inhabitants to concentration camps, and news of the exterminations that followed began to filter back into the ghetto.

But the residents of the ghetto were not without resistance, forming a band of partisans to fight against their captors. Despite their bravery, they were eventually defeated by German tanks and flamethrowers, and on May 16, 1943, the 56,000 survivors faced either summary execution or deportation to concentration and slave-labor camps.

It was SS Major General Jürgen Stroop who oversaw the clearing of the ghetto, and he proudly documented his actions in a leather-bound victory album called the Stroop Report. In its 75 pages, he included a list of his spoils, reports of daily killings, and a series of devastating photographs - including the iconic image of the boy with his hands raised. The report would later become key evidence against Stroop in the Nuremberg war-crimes trials, ultimately leading to his hanging near the very ghetto he had helped destroy.

While the Holocaust produced numerous heart-wrenching photographs, none have quite the same evidentiary impact as this image of the boy's surrender. Though his identity remains a mystery, the child has become a symbol for the 6 million Jews who lost their lives at the hands of the Nazis. It is a testament to the power of photography as a tool for documenting and exposing the worst of human atrocities.",Jürgen Stroop,
Bloody Saturday,1937,media/photo16.jpg,"""Bloody Saturday"" was taken during the Battle of Shanghai, a conflict between Chinese and Japanese forces in the early days of the Second Sino-Japanese War. ","The world was engulfed in a wave of imperialism that was seeping into Asia in the 1930s. Despite Japan's army's sweep into Shanghai, many Americans remained skeptical of involving themselves in a conflict that seemed like a far-off, alien land. But that began to change in the summer of 1937 when Japan's army of the Rising Sun marched towards Shanghai.

The fighting began in August, causing mass panic and death in the streets. However, the world didn't witness the victims' faces until the aftermath of the August 28 bombing by Japanese bombers.

H.S. Wong, a photographer for Hearst Metrotone News nicknamed Newsreel, arrived at the destroyed South Station to capture the tragedy. He recalls the devastation so fresh ""that my shoes were soaked with blood.""

Amidst the destruction, Wong saw a wailing Chinese baby whose mother lay dead on nearby tracks. He quickly shot his remaining film, and then ran to carry the baby to safety, but not before the boy’s father raced over and ferried him away.

Wong's image of the wounded, helpless infant was sent to New York and featured in Hearst newsreels, newspapers and life magazine. It reached over 136 million people and struck a personal chord that transcended ethnicity and geography.

To many, the infant’s pain represented the plight of China and the bloodlust of Japan, and the photo dubbed Bloody Saturday was transformed into one of the most powerful news pictures of all time. Its dissemination reveals the potent force of an image to sway official and public opinion.

Wong's picture led the U.S., Britain and France to formally protest the attack and helped shift Western sentiment in favor of involving themselves in what would become the world’s second great war.",H.S Wong,
Migrant Mother,1936,media/photo17.jpg,"The picture, ""Migrant Mother,"" was taken during the era of the Great Depression in the United States, a time of both economic hardship and social turbulence.","The Great Depression was more than just a crisis of economics, it was a crisis of humanity. Dorothea Lange understood this when she took the now-famous photo of Frances Owens Thompson and her children, known as Migrant Mother. But as Lange drove past the “Pea-Pickers Camp” sign in Nipomo, she almost didn’t stop. Something, however, compelled her to turn around.

In the sparse lean-to tent, Lange saw a mother who was hungry, desperate, and worn from worry and resignation. She tightly framed Thompson and her children, capturing their essence with her 4x5 Graflex camera. The resulting photo became the iconic image of the Depression, an intimate portrait of the toll being exacted across the land.

Lange’s photo wasn’t just a reflection of the times, it helped change them. After she informed the authorities of the plight of those at the encampment, they sent 20,000 pounds of food. By giving a face to a suffering nation, Lange’s image became a powerful symbol of hope and resilience, inspiring people to take action and work toward a better future.",Dorothea Lange,
The Hindenburg Disaster,1937,media/photo18.jpg,"Taken during the Great Depression, ""The Hindenburg Disaster"" was a significant event that had a lasting impact on the development of air travel and technology.","Zeppelins were the ultimate symbols of elegance and power, soaring majestically through the skies as a testament to their owners' wealth and prestige. When the LZ 129 Hindenburg airship arrived at the Lakehurst Naval Air Station in New Jersey on May 6, 1937, it was a major event. Among the crowd of journalists waiting to capture the moment was Sam Shere of International News Photos.

But what happened next was beyond anyone's imagination. As the Hindenburg approached the landing mast, its flammable hydrogen ignited, causing it to explode in a massive ball of fire that killed 36 people. Shere and other photographers scrambled to capture the unfolding tragedy, but it was Shere's image that would become the most iconic.

Published on front pages around the world and in LIFE magazine, Shere's photograph is a haunting reminder of the dangers of human error and technological fallibility. It also helped bring an end to the era of airships. Today, the image endures as a cautionary tale, a powerful and unforgettable symbol of human tragedy.",Sam Shere,
Guerillero Heroico,1960,media/photo19.jpg,"""Guerillero Heroico"" depicts Che Guevara at a memorial service for victims of a ship explosion in Havana. The photo became an iconic image of the Cuban Revolution and a symbol of revolutionary struggle and anti-imperialism.","The bearded revolutionary, his gaze locked on some imagined destiny, has become a universal icon. But when Alberto Korda took his picture in 1960, the man known as Che Guevara was still a largely unknown figure, a comrade of Fidel Castro's fighting to overthrow the U.S.-backed Batista dictatorship in Cuba.

The picture was a candid shot taken at a memorial service for victims of the La Coubre, a French freighter carrying arms for the Cuban government that had blown up in Havana harbor the day before. It was only years later that Korda's image would become one of the most recognizable in the world, a potent symbol of rebellion and defiance, embraced by radicals, protesters, and marketers alike.

Guevara himself would never have predicted his own posthumous fame. He was a guerrilla fighter, a doctor, and a Marxist philosopher who believed in the power of the individual to change history. But in Korda's picture, he became something more: an avatar of youthful idealism, a poster boy for a generation seeking to overthrow the established order.

The picture may have been an afterthought when Korda snapped it, but it has since become a cultural touchstone, a testament to the power of images to shape our collective memory. Even today, more than half a century after Guevara's death, Guerrillero Heroico remains a potent reminder of the human desire for freedom and justice.",Alberto Korda,
Dalí Atomicus,1948,media/photo20.jpg,"""Dalí Atomicus"" depicts Dalí after the war mid-air, along with various objects and animals suspended in the frame. ","Philippe Halsman was a master at capturing the essence of his subjects through his photography. But when it came to his longtime friend and collaborator, the surrealist painter Salvador Dalí, Halsman knew he had to create something truly special. Inspired by one of Dalí's paintings, Halsman constructed an elaborate scene featuring the original artwork, a floating chair, and an in-progress easel suspended by wires. As the photographer's wife and young daughter, along with other assistants, stood out of frame, they tossed three cats and a bucket of water into the air while Dalí leaped up.

It took Halsman and his team 26 takes to capture the perfect composition, but the final result was well worth the effort. The image, published in LIFE, is a stunning representation of Dalí's work, with the artist even adding his own touches to the print.

Halsman's approach to portrait photography was groundbreaking, bringing his subjects into sharp focus and capturing them in motion, rather than the traditional stilted and detached style of the past. His work with Dalí and other iconic figures such as Albert Einstein, Marilyn Monroe, and Alfred Hitchcock redefined portrait photography and inspired a new generation of photographers to collaborate with their subjects.",Philippe Halsman,
View From The Window At Le Gras,1826,media/photo21.jpg,"""View from the Window at Le Gras"" was taken by French inventor Joseph Nicéphore Niépce. The question is, is this photo artistic or very old?","The origins of photography are shrouded in a unique mix of ingenuity and curiosity, with its first known photograph produced by an inventor and not an artist. Joseph Nicéphore Niépce was a man fascinated by the printing method of lithography in the 1820s, where images were drawn on stone and reproduced using oil-based ink.

Niépce sought alternative methods to create images, leading him to set up a camera obscura device that captured and projected scenes illuminated by sunlight. Pointing the device out his eastern French studio window, the scene was cast on a treated pewter plate that retained a crude copy of the buildings and rooftops outside, becoming the first known permanent photograph.

Niépce’s achievement laid the groundwork for the development of photography, paving the way for advancements in sharpness and clarity such as those seen in artist Louis Daguerre’s daguerreotype images.",Joseph Nicéphore Niépce,
Leap Into Freedom,1961,media/photo22.jpg,"The photo ""Leap Into Freedom"" was taken when political and military tension between the Western powers and the Soviet Union. The photo shows German soldier Conrad Schumann leaping over the barbed separating wire fence.","In the early 1960s, Berlin was a divided city, with the victorious Allied powers holding the West and the Soviet Union occupying the East. Thousands of East Germans sought freedom by fleeing to the West, causing East German leader Walter Ulbricht to order the construction of a wall in August 1961. The following days saw one of the most dramatic moments of the Cold War.

19-year-old East German border guard Hans Conrad Schumann, disillusioned with the oppressive regime, decided to defect to the West. With a West Berlin crowd shouting “Come on over!” Schumann ran towards the barricade, dropping his rifle and jumping over the barbed wire.

Associated Press photographer Peter Leibing captured the iconic moment as Schumann cleared the wires and was whisked away by West Berliners. Leibing's photo was published on the front pages of newspapers around the world, making Schumann an instant symbol of those yearning for freedom.

But the weight of his new-found status as a poster child for freedom was too much for Schumann to bear. Despite living in the West, he struggled with the unintended consequences of his defection and eventually took his own life in 1998.",Peter Leibing,
The Hand Of Mrs. Wilhelm Röntgen,1895,media/photo23.jpg,"Taken by German physicist, this is an X-ray image that shows the bones in Mrs. Röntgen's hand, and is considered one of the most important and influential images in the history of science and medicine. ","It’s a story that epitomizes the adage, behind every great man is a great woman. The man in this case was Wilhelm Röntgen, the German physicist who in 1895 discovered the x-ray, a revolutionary technology that would transform the way we see the world inside our bodies. And the woman was Anna Bertha, his wife, who happened to be his first test subject.

With a cathode tube and a photographic plate, Wilhelm aimed the x-rays at Anna’s hand and produced an image that had never been seen before. The bones in her hand, hidden from sight until then, appeared like ghostly shadows on the plate. Wilhelm was stunned by what he had discovered and dubbed the phenomenon “x-ray”.

The image of Anna’s hand became a global sensation, and x-rays quickly became an essential tool in medicine. Doctors could now see inside the human body without surgery and diagnose diseases and injuries that had previously been invisible. Wilhelm was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1901 for his groundbreaking work.

But while Wilhelm basked in the glory of his discovery, Anna was deeply disturbed by the image of her own hand. She reportedly said, “I have seen my death.” But her sacrifice and her husband’s discovery have saved countless lives since then. It’s a reminder that sometimes, even the most mundane or ordinary things can be transformed by human curiosity and ingenuity into something truly extraordinary.",Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen,
Flag Raising On Iwo Jima,1945,media/photo24.jpg,"""Flag Raising on Iwo Jima"" shows US Marines raising the American flag on Mount Sukiyaki during the Battle of Iwo Jima, a key battle in the Pacific Theatre of the war. ","Iwo Jima, a speck of an island blocking the Allies’ march toward Japan, became a crucial battleground during the Pacific War. The Americans needed the island as an air base, but the Japanese were entrenched and ready to fight. On February 19, 1945, U.S. troops landed and commenced a month of fierce fighting that claimed the lives of 6,800 Americans and 21,000 Japanese.

On the fifth day of battle, the Marines scaled Mount Suribachi and planted an American flag. But the commander called for a bigger one, hoping to inspire his men and demoralize the enemy. Associated Press photographer Joe Rosenthal hauled his cumbersome Speed Graphic camera to the top and, as five Marines and a Navy corpsman prepared to raise the Stars and Stripes, Rosenthal almost missed the shot.

“The sky was overcast,” he later wrote of what became one of the most famous images of war. “The wind just whipped the flag out over the heads of the group, and at their feet, the disrupted terrain and the broken stalks of the shrubbery exemplified the turbulence of war.”

Two days later, Rosenthal’s photograph was splashed on front pages across the U.S. and embraced as a symbol of unity in the long-fought war. The picture, which earned Rosenthal a Pulitzer Prize, resonated so much that it was made into a postage stamp and cast as a 100-ton bronze memorial. For many, it represents the bravery and sacrifice of the American troops who fought in the Pacific War.",Joe Rosenthal,
Emmett Till,1955,media/photo25.jpg,"The photo ""Emmett Till"" was taken after the brutal murder of Emmett Till, a 14-year-old African American boy, in Mississippi, USA. Till's disfigured and mutilated body became a powerful symbol of the violence and racism faced by African Americans during the Jim Crow era.","Emmett Till, a 14-year-old black teenager from Chicago, was visiting his relatives in Mississippi in August 1955 when he encountered Carolyn Bryant, a white woman, at Bryant’s Grocery and Meat Market. The circumstances of their interaction are unknown. But what is known is that four days later, Roy Bryant and J.W. Milam, Carolyn’s husband and half-brother, respectively, abducted Till from his great-uncle’s house, brutally beat and shot him, and then disposed of his body in the Tallahatchie River after wrapping barbed wire and a heavy metal fan around his neck.

Despite overwhelming evidence, a white jury acquitted the killers, with one juror admitting that the deliberations only took so long because they had to take breaks for sodas. When Till’s mother, Mamie, arrived to identify her son’s body, she made a decision that would reverberate across the world: “Let the people see what I’ve seen,” she told the funeral director, insisting on an open casket.

Tens of thousands of people filed past Till’s remains, but it was the publication of a photograph in Jet magazine that truly galvanized the world. The image showed Mamie, with a stoic expression, gazing at her son’s battered body, and it forced the public to confront the ugliness of American racism. For nearly a century, African Americans had been lynched with shocking regularity and without punishment. Thanks to Mamie’s tenacity in exposing the barbarity of her son’s murder, the public could no longer turn a blind eye to the violence and injustice that had been hidden from view for too long.",David Jackson,
Cotton Mill Girl,1908,media/photo26.jpg,"Captured during the Industrial Revolution, ""Cotton Mill Girl"" depicts a young girl working in harsh conditions in a textile mill in New England.","Lewis Hine believed that pictures could change the world. As an investigative photographer for the National Child Labor Committee, he used his camera to document the brutal exploitation of child laborers in mills and factories across the United States. To gain access to these sweatshops, Hine posed as a variety of characters, from Bible sellers to industrial photographers. Armed with his large-format camera and a hidden notebook, Hine captured haunting images of children toiling in meatpacking houses, coal mines, and canneries.

But it was his photo of Sadie Pfeifer that would become his most iconic. At just 48 inches tall, she was dwarfed by the gargantuan cotton-spinning machine she was tasked with running in Lancaster, South Carolina. Hine's images revealed the harsh realities of child labor in stark detail, and thanks in part to his efforts, the number of child laborers in the United States was cut nearly in half from 1910 to 1920. Through his work, Hine proved that pictures really could be worth a thousand words—and a thousand actions.",Lewis Hine,
Hitler At A Nazi Party Rally,1934,media/photo27.jpg,"Adolf Hitler addressing a crowd of supporters at a Nazi Party gathering during Germany's rise, while the United States saw the end of Prohibition, China underwent the Long March, and the Soviet Union went through the Great Purge.","The Nazis were masters of spectacle, and no one did it better than Heinrich Hoffmann, Hitler’s personal photographer and propagandist. With his keen eye for choreographing the regime’s propaganda events, Hoffmann played a crucial role in selling Hitler’s growing pageant of power to a wounded German public.

One of Hoffmann’s most striking photographs was taken at the Bückeberg Harvest Festival in September 1934. In this rigidly symmetrical composition, Hitler stands at the center of a grand Wagnerian fantasy, surrounded by adoring and heiling troops. This and countless other extravaganzas captured by Hoffmann fed the regime’s vast propaganda machine and spread its demonic dream.

Such images were all-pervasive in Hitler’s Reich, which shrewdly used Hoffmann’s photos, the stark graphics on Nazi banners, and the films of Leni Riefenstahl to make Aryanism seem worthy of godlike worship. A nation humiliated by World War I, punishing reparations, and the Great Depression eagerly rallied behind Hitler’s visage and his seemingly invincible men. Hoffmann’s expertly rendered propaganda is a testament to photography’s power to move nations and plunge a world into war.",Heinrich Hoffmann,
Gandhi And The Spinning Wheel,1946,media/photo28.jpg,"""'Gandhi and the Spinning Wheel' was taken during the struggle for India's independence from British colonial rule, while the world witnessed the founding of the United Nations and the start of the Nuremberg trials in Germany.""","The image of Mohandas Gandhi sitting cross-legged and reading a newspaper while spinning yarn with a charkha may appear to be a simple snapshot. However, it is a powerful and poignant portrayal of the Indian nationalist leader and his fight for independence from British colonial rule.

When Margaret Bourke-White, a LIFE photographer, visited Gandhi in his compound, she was asked to learn to spin the yarn before photographing the leader. Gandhi's spinning had become a symbol of his campaign for independence, encouraging fellow Indians to make their own cloth instead of buying British goods.

Bourke-White's photograph, which did not appear in her original article, gained prominence in LIFE's tribute to Gandhi after his assassination in 1948. It captured Gandhi's humility, simplicity, and commitment to his ideals. The image has since become an enduring icon, representing Gandhi's struggle and inspiring generations of activists around the world.",Margaret Bourke-White,
"Fetus, 18 Weeks",1965,media/photo29.jpg,"""Fetus, 18 Weeks"" was taken pre-2000 during a period when abortion was still illegal in most states in the US. In the years following the photo's publication, the debate over reproductive rights and the ethics of abortion continued to intensify, leading to landmark Supreme Court cases such as Roe v. Wade","In 1965, LIFE magazine published a groundbreaking photo essay by Lennart Nilsson titled “Drama of Life Before Birth.” The issue was an instant sell-out, and for good reason. Nilsson's images publicly revealed for the first time what a developing fetus looks like, raising pointed new questions about when life begins.

To create the essay, Nilsson struck a deal with a hospital in Stockholm. The doctors called him whenever a fetus was available to photograph, and Nilsson arranged the fetuses in a dedicated room with lights and lenses specially designed for the project. The fetuses were posed in such a way that they appeared to be floating as if in the womb.

Though Nilsson explained in the accompanying story that all but one of the fetuses had been removed from the womb for a variety of medical reasons, anti-abortion activists have used the images to advance their cause. Nevertheless, Nilsson’s images endure for their unprecedentedly clear, detailed view of human life at its earliest stages.",Lennart Nilsson,
D-Day,1944,media/photo30.jpg,"""D-Day"" was taken during one of the World Wars. Allied troops storming the beaches of Normandy, France, in the largest amphibious invasion in history.","As the Allies stormed the beaches of Normandy on June 6, 1944, LIFE magazine sent their ace photographer Robert Capa to capture the action. Capa was the only still photographer to join the 34,250 troops who landed on Omaha Beach that day. He captured images of American soldiers as they stormed the beaches under the barrage of German fire. Among his subjects was Private First Class Huston Riley, a 22-year-old soldier who was struck several times while struggling to reach the Normandy shore.

Capa's iconic photo of Riley shows him wading through the surf, with his helmet on his back and his rifle in his right hand. The image captures the frenzied, chaotic atmosphere of the D-Day invasion, with smoke, explosions, and gunfire all around. Capa himself spent an hour and a half under fire, capturing images that would become some of the most powerful and memorable of the war.

Despite the dangers and difficulties, Capa managed to take four rolls of film during the landing. However, due to a mishap during processing, most of the frames were lost. Only a handful of images survived, and they have a grainy, blurry look that adds to their sense of frenetic motion. Capa's work on Omaha Beach would go on to become some of the most iconic and enduring images of World War II.",Robert Capa,
