              <h2>Time Lens Rulebook</h2>
              <p>In Time Lens, players are awarded points based on their accuracy, speed and ability to maintain a streak of correct guesses. The following is a detailed breakdown of the scoring system.</p>
              <h3>The Correct Guess</h3>
              <p>If a player manages to guess the correct year, they are granted 1000 points as a starting reward. But, as with any find game that wants to make its rules as complicated as possible so that in appears legit, there are additional factors at play.</p>
              <p>The Streak: Should the player be on a streak of correct guesses without using hints, they receive a bonus of 10 points multiplied by their current streak count. </p>
              <p>Time Bonus: Proving that haste can indeed be rewarded, for each 5 seconds remaining on the clock, the player is gifted additional points.</p>
              <h3>The Incorrect Guess</h3>
              <p>For those unfortunate souls who fall short of the correct answer, there is still hope. Points are awarded based on how close they come to the right year.</p>
              <p>A Mere 5 Years Off: In this case, the player receives 500 points, minus 10 points for each year they are off.</p>
              <p>A Decade's Difference: For guesses falling within 6 to 10 years of the correct year, the player receives 450 points, minus 15 points for each year beyond the initial 5-year margin.</p>
              <p>The 20-Year Range: If a player's guess is within 11 to 20 years of the correct answer, they receive 300 points, minus 10 points for each year beyond the initial 10-year margin.</p>
              <p>Wildly Off: Alas, for those who are more than 20 years off, there are no points awarded. Better luck next time!</p>
              <h3>Quick Answer Bonus:</h3>
              <p>As a nod to those nimble-minded players, bonus points are awarded for rapid responses:</p>
              <p>Lightning Speed: Should a player answer within 30 seconds, they receive an additional 50 points.</p>
              <p>Merely Swift: If the player answers within 20 to 30 seconds, they are granted an extra 25 points.</p>
              <p>As players navigate this Time Lens, their scores are calculated and displayed accordingly, reflecting the intricacies of this unique system. May fortune favour the bold, the swift and the precise!</p>
